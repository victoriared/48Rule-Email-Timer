48Rule: Email Response Timer (Chrome Extension)



‚è≥ Respond, Don't Procrastinate

48Rule is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to combat email procrastination by holding you accountable to a self-imposed response deadline.



When you receive a new email, a timer automatically starts counting down from 48 hours (or your preferred 24-hour setting). The timer remains visible on the email until you reply or explicitly dismiss it, providing a constant, gentle nudge to keep your inbox moving.



‚ú® Features

Real-time Countdown: A visible timer (H:MM:SS) injected directly into the email list view.



Configurable Time Limit: Easily switch between 48-hour and 24-hour default limits via the extension popup menu.



Persistence: Timers are saved locally across browser sessions using Chrome Storage.



Dismissal: Ability to manually dismiss the timer (e.g., if the email requires no action).



Time Expired Alert: The timer visually changes when the deadline is reached.

Important Note on Compatibility

The core functionality in content.js relies on specific CSS selectors to identify and inject the timer into webmail clients. These selectors often break when mail services (like Gmail, Outlook) update their UI. Community contributions to maintain up-to-date selectors for various platforms are highly appreciated!
